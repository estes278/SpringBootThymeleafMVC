Finally, we followed the bonus lecture to create a User Registration feature, which allows a user to create a new account with all of their information, have their details stored in the database, and then allows them to log in and access the site in the same way as our hard coded users. This part was particularly cool! It includes validation to ensure the user is entering good details (non null, name longer than 1 char, etc.
NOTE: This is the only project where I did not actually create the code myself. I simply copied and ran the example code because it had numerous classes that were not covered in the lectures and I was not aware of how to create them myself. This process was a bit more complicated than I was expecting, but I am keeping the code in my Github as a reference so I can figure out how to implement this myself one day!
