The final lesson took us back to our previous Spring MVC CRUD app, where we applied our newfound knowledge to add @Before and @AfterReturning advisors to all of the methods in our controller, service, and DAO packages. It was very cool to see this advice go to work on existing code after adding a few simple methods and a new AOP class! AOP is certainly a powerful tool and Iâ€™m excited to implement it in my future programs.
