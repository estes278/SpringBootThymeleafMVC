Our next objective is to create a web UI for the employee directory we began work on in a previous project. Our users should be able to perform all CRUD operations using the UI provided, including Get a list of employees, add a new employee, update or delete an employee. We will have connectivity to a backend database as well. We learned a few tricks involving HTML, Thymeleaf and Spring to allow us to pre-populate forms with data from our DB, as well as appending the employee ID to the URL for update/delete operations. We learned some basic CSS using Bootstrap so that our pages wouldnâ€™t look like crap as well.
